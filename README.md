# ac-mod-tier-vendors
Tier Vendors' Mod for AzerothCore with Eluna

## Description
This adds three vendor npcs that can dispense loot from the earlier raids, for collecting

## Getting started
Clone to your `lua_scripts` directory, then run the SQL against your world database, should be good to go from there

## Remarks
Make sure the entry ids in the constants LUA files and the SQL file match, this is necessary when you need to change them due to existing custom NPCs from other scripts
